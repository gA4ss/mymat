  * @section 介绍
  * This package provides code templates for use by GLAST developers. 
  * All header files for external access are located in the templates directory,
  * as it is customary to put external public header files in the packageName 
  * directory. Header files that are not meant for external access reside in 
  * the src directory. Source files are located in the src directory. Files 
  * related to loading sharable libraries are located in the src/Dll directory.
  * There are 3 examples:
  * 
  * - User-Defined generic C++ class
  * -# templates/ClassTemplate.h
  * -# src/ClassTemplate.cxx
  * - User-Defined Gaudi Algorithm
  * -# src/ExampleAlg.cxx
  * -# src/Dll/templates_dll.cxx
  * -# src/Dll/templates_load.cxx
  *
  *
  * Also note the existence of the following directories:
  * - cmt
  * -# Contains the requirements file
  * - doc
  * -# Contains the release.notes file
  *
  *

  * of our current
